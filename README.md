## Description

_This is a simple web application created independently by me for week two of Epicodus which will be reviewed. This web app will serve as a demonstration of my understanding of basic business logic using Javascript and jQuery 3.3.1. The user must fill out personal information in a webform and answer several multiple choice questions and click the submit button. Depending on the user input provided, they will be shown a customized message recommending one of several tracks provided by epicodus._
